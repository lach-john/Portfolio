1: Compile client and server 
2: Begin Server using java TaxServer (insert your port number of choice)
3: Begin Client using java TaxClient (same port number as sever)

- Client will only accept commands typed in upper case, the prompt presented to the client illustrates this
- Commands in lower case will not crash the server, the prompt will just be returned until a legitimate command or number is entered
- User is able to enter either a legitimate command or enter a number to receive a tax appraisal 
- TAX, UPDATE, QUERY and END all function as specified 

- BYE enables user to disconnect whilst server remains running. However, server jumps to port number + 1 of original port and waits for new client
- This also wipes the tax brackets entered by a previous user. 
- To connect a new client, enter: java TaxClient (old port number + 1)
